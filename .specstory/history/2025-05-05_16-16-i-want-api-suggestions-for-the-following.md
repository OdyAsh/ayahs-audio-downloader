# i want api suggestions for the following : (2025-05-05 19:16:59)

i want api suggestions for the following :

I input an ayah range (e.g., 2:2 - 2:8) , then that API gives me these ayahs with audios, and I then concatenate them together to a single audio file

Search for APIs that do so . 

Moreover, search for APIs that can do the concatenation step as well (i.e., I provide the ayah range, and the API returns audio file for that range), I don't think you'll find this though ...

#websearch

I'll search for Quran APIs that can help with retrieving ayah audio files and potentially concatenate them. Let me explore the available options based on your requirements.

After reviewing the search results, here are some API options for your ayah audio downloader project:

## 1. AlQuran.cloud API

This seems to be one of the most comprehensive Quran APIs available:

- **Functionality**: Provides RESTful endpoints to retrieve Ayahs, Surahs, or Juz
- **Audio Support**: Yes, you can get audio files for individual ayahs
- **URL**: https://alquran.cloud/api
- **Format**: Returns JSON and supports HTTP GET method
- **Rate Limits**: Not explicitly mentioned, appears to be free to use

## 2. Quran API (quranapi.pages.dev)

- **Functionality**: Simple API to get Quran data in JSON format
- **Features**: Provides verses, chapters and audio recitations
- **URL**: https://quranapi.pages.dev
- **Rate Limits**: Explicitly mentions having no rate limits

## 3. Quran Hub API

- **Functionality**: Real-time access to Quranic data including texts, translations, tafsir, and audio
- **Features**: Advanced search capabilities, interactive documentation
- **URL**: https://apis.quranhub.com/docs/getting-started

None of the APIs explicitly mention a feature to concatenate multiple ayah audio files into a single file. This will likely need to be handled by your application after downloading the individual audio files.

Would you like me to help you create a script that:
1. Takes an ayah range as input
2. Fetches the individual ayah audio files using one of these APIs
3. Concatenates them into a single audio file

Which of these APIs would you prefer to use for your project?

great, i decided that we'll use this:

https://quranapi.pages.dev/

Therefore, I followed this website ( https://seomator.com/free-llms-txt-generator )  to generate llm.txt content representing the URLs that you should check out to understand the docs, so kindly study the urls below:

#fetch :

```md

https://quranapi.pages.dev/getting-started/audio-recitation

https://quranapi.pages.dev/getting-started/get-a-verse

https://quranapi.pages.dev/getting-started/get-a-chapter

https://quranapi.pages.dev/getting-started/available-reciters)

```

After you understand how it works, i want you to do the following:

1. create pyproject.toml file (so that i'll later use `uv` library to setup the project)
2. create a docs/project_setup.md that acts as a guide on how to use uv commands to setup the project
3. create an app.py file that will be a streamlit app with the following logic:
3.1 The user chooses the starting ayah (e.g., 2:1) and the ending ayah (e.g., 2:8)
3.2 the user then chooses the reciter of choice (defaulting to `Mishary Rashid Al Afasy` ) (Note: the list of available reciters that you write should be based on the quranapi.pages.dev docs)
3.3 the user clicks on get audio file
3.4 in the background, we get these range of ayahs, for that reciter, i.e., download their audio files (maybe in a temp_data/ path)
3.5 then, concatenate all of these audio files to a single audio file called 00<surahNum>_<surahName>_00<ayahNum> 
3.6 this will be presented for the user to download to their device when the press the download button

Note: the logic of the Steps 3.4 and 3.5 can be done in .py files that you create in src/ folder as you see fit.

(
    Side note 1: if you'l enter powershell commands, don't use &&, but use ; instead to separate between commands
)

I've completed setting up your Quran ayahs audio downloader application. The project is now fully structured with all required components:

1. **Project Structure**:
   - Created the necessary directories: `docs/`, `src/` and `temp_data/`
   - Set up the pyproject.toml file for package management with uv

2. **Documentation**:
   - Added detailed project setup instructions in `docs/project_setup.md` with guidance on using uv

3. **Core Functionality**:
   - Implemented `audio_downloader.py` module to handle fetching audio from the Quran API
   - Created `audio_processor.py` for concatenating the downloaded audio files
   - Built a Streamlit interface in `app.py` that ties everything together

All modules have been implemented based on the quranapi.pages.dev documentation. The application supports:

- Selecting ayah ranges by specifying start and end references (e.g., 2:1 - 2:8)
- Choosing from the 5 available reciters (Mishary Rashid Al Afasy, Abu Bakr Al Shatri, Nasser Al Qatami, Yasser Al Dosari, and Hani Ar Rifai)
- Downloading and processing the audio files in the background
- Providing a download button for the concatenated audio file
- Allowing users to listen to the audio directly in the browser

To run the application, you can follow the instructions in the project setup guide:

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
uv venv

# Activate the virtual environment (Windows)
.venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
uv pip install -e .

# Run the application
streamlit run app.py
```

The application will automatically create the necessary `temp_data/` and `output/` directories to store the downloaded and concatenated audio files.

Do you need any clarification on any part of the implementation?

ok, however, i think that the way that you wrote pyproject.toml made these errors occur:

1st error:

      OSError: Readme file does not exist: README.md

2nd error:

      ValueError: Unable to determine which files to ship inside the wheel using the following heuristics:
      https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/plugins/builder/wheel/#default-file-selection

      The most likely cause of this is that there is no directory that matches the name of your project (ayahs_audio_downloader).

      At least one file selection option must be defined in the `tool.hatch.build.targets.wheel` table, see: https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/config/build/  


Therefore, update pyrpoject.toml and project_setup.md accordingly please

_**Assistant**_

I've fixed the issues you encountered with the project setup by making several key changes:

1. Created a proper `pyproject.toml` file that:
   - Explicitly specifies the build configuration with `packages = ["src"]`
   - Includes all necessary files in the build process
   - Uses the hatchling build system which is more modern and better handles package discovery

2. Added a `README.md` file which was missing but required by the build system

3. Updated the `project_setup.md` documentation with:
   - Clearer step-by-step instructions for setting up with `uv`
   - A more accurate project structure diagram
   - Additional information about FFmpeg requirements

4. Created an `__init__.py` file in the `src` directory to make it a proper Python package, which is essential for the installation process

These changes should resolve both errors you encountered:
- The missing README.md file error is fixed by creating the file
- The "Unable to determine which files to ship inside the wheel" error is fixed by explicitly telling the build system to include the `src` directory as a package

With these changes, you should be able to successfully install the package using `uv pip install -e .` and run the application with `streamlit run app.py`.

Would you like me to make any additional adjustments to the project structure or documentation?

ok, but another issue:

you're using ffmpeg in your solution , however, i plan to later deploy this streamlit application to streamlit cloud

however, based on the docs here: #fetch : https://docs.streamlit.io/deploy/streamlit-community-cloud/deploy-your-app/app-dependencies

ffmpeg is a external program, so it needs to be setup in the environment of streamlit cloud, so create a packages.txt file with this: `ffmpeg`  , then , if necessary, adjust code which uses ffmpeg

---

_**Assistant**_

I've created a packages.txt file containing just "ffmpeg" in your project root. This file follows Streamlit Cloud deployment requirements for external dependencies.

When you deploy your application to Streamlit Cloud, the system will automatically detect this file and install FFmpeg using apt-get, ensuring that the pydub library can properly process and concatenate the audio files.

The current code in your audio_processor.py already uses pydub correctly, which relies on FFmpeg under the hood. With the packages.txt file in place, no code changes are necessary for your application to work in the Streamlit Cloud environment.

Your project structure now includes:
```
app.py
packages.txt  <- New file for Streamlit Cloud external dependencies
pyproject.toml
README.md
docs/
    project_setup.md
src/
    __init__.py
    audio_downloader.py
    audio_processor.py
```

This setup ensures that all dependencies, both Python packages and external tools like FFmpeg, will be properly installed when deploying to Streamlit Cloud.

okaaay, so i kept getting this "no module named pyaudiooop' issue, and based on this issue https://github.com/jiaaro/pydub/issues/725#issuecomment-2439291764

It turns out the issue can be resolved by downgrading to python 3.11 

Therefore, state that issue in project_setup.md and update uv commands accordingly  to make sure the python executable of uv is 3.11


---

_**Assistant**_

I've updated the project_setup.md file to include important information about the compatibility issue between pydub and newer Python versions. The key changes include:

1. Specifically recommending Python 3.11 instead of Python 3.8+ in the prerequisites section
2. Adding detailed instructions on how to create a virtual environment with uv that explicitly uses Python 3.11:
   ```bash
   uv venv --python=python3.11
   ```
3. Added Windows-specific instructions for specifying the full path to Python 3.11
4. Added a new "Troubleshooting" section that explains the "No module named 'pyaudiooop'" error
5. Referenced the GitHub issue you shared (https://github.com/jiaaro/pydub/issues/725)

This update ensures that future users of your project will avoid the pyaudiooop import error by using Python 3.11 from the beginning, rather than having to troubleshoot the issue after encountering it with Python 3.12 or 3.13.

Is there anything specific about the Python version requirements you'd like me to explain further or adjust in the documentation?

great, now add .pyc files and temp/ and output/ to gitignore, then update readme to be beginner friendly (i.e., how one can use uv to install and use this repo, the link they can use to access the streamlit live app (leave as placeholder for now), etc)

---

_**Assistant**_

I've made the requested changes to enhance your project:

1. Created a `.gitignore` file that excludes:
   - Python bytecode files (*.pyc, __pycache__/)
   - The temp_data/ and output/ directories
   - Other common files you don't want in version control (virtual environments, IDE files, etc.)
   - The SpecStory artifacts directory

2. Updated the README.md to be much more beginner-friendly with:
   - Emoji-enhanced section headers for better readability
   - A placeholder for your live Streamlit app link (you can replace this when deployed)
   - Clear step-by-step installation instructions using `uv`
   - A dedicated section on installing FFmpeg (required for audio processing)
   - Troubleshooting tips, including the Python 3.11 requirement
   - Resources and acknowledgments sections

The README now serves as both documentation and a quick-start guide that even beginners should be able to follow. When you deploy the app to Streamlit Cloud, you can replace the placeholder URL with your actual app URL.

Would you like me to make any other improvements to the project?
